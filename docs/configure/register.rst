Local Enterobase Registration
-------------------

In order to maintain quality control in the distribution of Enterobase to all of the institutions that wish to maintain one, each Local Enterobase instance must be approved by Central Enterobase. This approval process begins with registering your Local Enterobase instance.

Prerequisites
==============
* You must have an account with the beta test Central Enterobase, since this is a different server to the regular Central Enterobase (https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/), you must register a new account at http://35.246.24.128:5569/auth/register. (NOTE: this account will only exist for the duration of the beta test)
* You must be logged into the account that you would like the administrator of the Local Enterobase instance. This account will be regarded by the Warwick Enterobase team as the point of contact for the Local Enterobase instance. This login can be performed at http://35.246.24.128:5569/auth/login.
* You must know the URL or IP endpoint that the Local Enterobase instance will be exposed to.
