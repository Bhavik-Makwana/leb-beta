Approving Your Local EnteroBase
--------------------------------

* Following a successful upload test, which verifies tht your Local EnteroBase is correctly installed and configured, you must contact a Central EnteroBase admin to approve your Local EnteroBase instance, providing your name, organisation/institution, and the name of your Local EnteroBase instance. Feel free to leave the page until you are emailed again as you will return back to this page.
* **For the beta test**, please contact Harry who is acting as the Central EnteroBase admin (h.fallows@warwick.ac.uk)
* The Central EnteroBase Admin will email back your Central EnteroBase OAuth tokens that enable you to fully utilise Local EnteroBase using your Central EnteroBase credentials. The OAuth tokens are a client ID and client secret.
* Submit your OAuth credentials and the form should expand to show the details that cenntral enterobase has about your local enterobase instance for you to verify your details. If this matches up, press confirm to submit the details.

Press resubmit to refresh the retreived details in case they may change.
If we do not have details associated with your submitted credentials, an error message will display and we suggest getting in contact with the admin.


* Inside the system configuration form (Fig. 1), there is a “Warwick temporary token” field, local adminstrator should set this value using the token whihc he has received by email. Then local adminstrator should select “File Uploads Test” option then click “Start” button (Fig. 2).
* After submitting the upload test results, the registration request will be verified by Warwick EnteroBase administrator.
* Once the registration request has been approved, local administrator  will receive an email which will contain the client id and a client password which will be used to authorize the communication between the local installation and the Warwick EnteroBase.
* Local administrator needs to update your system configuration using these values and restart the application. At this stage, the system is ready and can be used.
