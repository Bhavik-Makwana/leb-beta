# leb-beta
Hosting documentation for the beta version of Local EnteroBase. The main purpose of Local EnteroBase version is to enable our partners (users) to assemble their read files locally and send the strain metadata along with the assembly files to Central EnteroBase hosted at Warwick (enterobase.warwick.ac.uk).

The source code repository address is https://bitbucket.org/enterobase/local_enterobase/.
